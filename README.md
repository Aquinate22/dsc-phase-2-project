## Business Problem:
The company's problem was stated

## Business Understanding
The company's formation, goals and mission were understood

## Data Mining and Understanding
Obtained the data from Canvas
descriptive statistics was performed
the info of the data was looked at
data types were evaluated
some columns were dropped
null values were looked into
some columns with null values were dropped while others were filled
renaming of columns 

## Data Exploration
Looking into the data


correlation heatmap was plotted and the correlation results analyzes

a new data set was created to look into the effect of house renovation

different states of house renovation were plotted in tableau

visualizations between different features were then plotted to understand how different features affect one another

### plots on how grade of the house relates with other house features

### plots on how condition of the house relates with other  house features

### plots on how number of bedrooms in a house relate with other house features

### plots on how the age of the house relates with other house features

histogram and kde of different features

## Building, Evaluating and validating a Model

### Linear regression model

### Multiple Linear Regression Model

### Decision Tree Regression (DTR)

### Random Forest Regression (RFR)

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)

# Compairing the MSE of RFR, DTR, and SVR

The model with the lowest MSE is the best model

### Validating Models with:
### Cross validation
### Train-Test split

choosing the best model after validation

Performing Simple Linear Regression of different features

Answering analytical Questions 

# Conclusion
